The XT was Subaru <http://everything2.com/title/Subaru>'s first attempt
at producing a sports car <http://everything2.com/title/sports+car>.
They launched this arrow <http://everything2.com/title/arrow> shaped 4
wheel drive <http://everything2.com/title/4+wheel+drive> beast in 1985.
The most notable thing about the XT was that it broke the record for air
resistance <http://everything2.com/title/air+resistance> with a .29
coefficient of drag <http://everything2.com/title/coefficient+of+drag>.
This record may still be standing today, (I can't find any records of it
being broken).

The XT featured 4 wheel drive
<http://everything2.com/title/4+wheel+drive>, (later changed to all
wheel drive <http://everything2.com/title/all+wheel+drive>), 4 wheel
independent adjustable suspension
<http://everything2.com/title/adjustable+suspension>, (this used airbags
like big diesel trucks have), and a turbocharger
<http://everything2.com/title/turbocharger>. The XT was eventually
replaced by the Subaru SVX <http://everything2.com/title/Subaru+SVX>.
But the SVX was in a different class. The XT was a Camaro
<http://everything2.com/title/Camaro> fighter. While the SVX competed on
Corvette <http://everything2.com/title/Corvette> level in the automotive
<http://everything2.com/title/automotive> arena.

Xt, or "X Toolkit Intrinsics", assists in the construction and use of
widget set <http://everything2.com/title/widget+set>s under the X Window
System <http://everything2.com/title/X+Window+System>. Xt doesn't
directly provide any widget functionality; instead, it provides some
depth of abstraction above Xlib <http://everything2.com/title/Xlib>, and
above C <http://everything2.com/title/C> itself, for creating and using
high-level widgets. Xt widget <http://everything2.com/title/widget>s are
written using Xlib <http://everything2.com/title/Xlib> with complicated
Xt function <http://everything2.com/title/function>s and data structure
<http://everything2.com/title/data+structure>s, and can be used with Xt
calls or wrapper functions (a la Motif
<http://everything2.com/title/Motif>). There are a few major Xt widget
sets still in major use, namely Athena
<http://everything2.com/title/Athena> (Xaw) and Motif
<http://everything2.com/title/Motif>, and a few others that are obsolete.

Most modern X widget sets are not made with Xt, partly because other
languages and styles have proved to be a better foundation, especially
as regards object orientation. GTK+
<http://everything2.com/title/GTK%252B>, for instance, is built on it's
own Xlib wrapper <http://everything2.com/title/wrapper> called GDK
<http://everything2.com/title/GDK>. In fact, the abstractive parts of Xt
are analogous to those parts of GDK <http://everything2.com/title/GDK>
and GObject <http://everything2.com/title/GObject>. QT
<http://everything2.com/title/QT> uses C++ classes and its extension of
C++ for similar purposes. (As a side not, GTK+ and QT completely hide
XLib; XT does not.)

The original generation of X applications and utilities were created
using the Xt widget sets Athena <http://everything2.com/title/Athena>
and Motif <http://everything2.com/title/Motif>, and occasionally
something obscure like OLIT. Some of these applications, like xterm
<http://everything2.com/title/xterm> and xclock
<http://everything2.com/title/xclock>, are still in use today. Motif
<http://everything2.com/title/Motif> and the CDE
<http://everything2.com/title/CDE> have historically been the X11
environment of choice for commercial Unix, though they are slowly being
edged out by the newer GNOME <http://everything2.com/title/GNOME>, KDE
<http://everything2.com/title/KDE>, and others; and are rarely used on
modern OSS <http://everything2.com/title/OSS> systems.

The Xt specification states quite clearly that it is supposed to be
somewhat object-oriented <http://everything2.com/title/object-oriented>.
Most OO nuts would balk at this, but it is true; Xt allows definition of
class <http://everything2.com/title/class>es (ostensibly all widgets),
instantiation <http://everything2.com/title/instantiation> of classes as
widgets, inheritance <http://everything2.com/title/inheritance>,
encapsulation <http://everything2.com/title/encapsulation>, and
polymorphism <http://everything2.com/title/polymorphism>. That said, it
does not have the clarity or ease of use one would expect. Thus, it is
Object Orientation <http://everything2.com/title/Object+Orientation>
proper and not the proverbial language-specific easy-as-pie OO that was
supposed to be All That Is Programming by now 10 years ago. A diagram of
that sentence is left to the reader as an excercise, and so is trying to
figure out if I'm advocating C <http://everything2.com/title/C> or
eastern religion <http://everything2.com/title/eastern+religion>.


        Literature

The definitive source of information about Xt is the specification,
available in PostScript <http://everything2.com/title/PostScript> with
the X11R6 distribution or available on the web (see below). There are a
great number of books, mostly from the late 80's, with information on
Xlib <http://everything2.com/title/Xlib>, Xt
<http://everything2.com/title/Xt> and Motif
<http://everything2.com/title/Motif>, most notably the Animal Books.
<http://everything2.com/title/O%2527Reilly> It should be noted that the
X manuals were some of O'Reilly's earliest publications.


        Athena

The Athena widget set is included in the X Window System distribution
and is used to build the popular client programs from that package.
Xterm <http://everything2.com/title/Xterm>, xedit
<http://everything2.com/title/xedit>, xman
<http://everything2.com/title/xman>, xload
<http://everything2.com/title/xload> and so forth are all programmed
with Xt using Athena. Athena is not visually impressive, but it is free,
standard and well documented. I've written my examples in athena because
I like it and it mainly uses Xt calls instead of wrappers, and because
you are you are guaranteed to have it if you have X.


        Big, scary example program

Here's an example program for your perusal. It's not really a tutorial,
though I've included a simpler "Hello, world!
<http://everything2.com/title/Hello%252C+world%2521>" program below.
Browse my Athena <http://everything2.com/title/Athena> writeup for a
slower intro. Real knowledge of the C language is expected (Pointer
<http://everything2.com/title/Pointer>s, function pointer
<http://everything2.com/title/function+pointer>s, struct
<http://everything2.com/title/struct> pointers...).

This program will let you enter text into a text box
<http://everything2.com/title/text+box>, and echo to standard output
when you press the button <http://everything2.com/title/button>. This
program is not very useful, as it is just a simplified 'echo
<http://everything2.com/title/echo>' with an unwieldy X interface. (It
could be used as a hideous text editor via redirection, though.) If I
added CLIPBOARD support to it, it could pass as a deranged xclipboard
<http://everything2.com/title/xclipboard>.

This program is not quite trivial (by tutorial standards), but not
useful. It seperates into initializing the tookit, creating basic
elements, and running the event loop. Each of the buttons calls a
function, and the text box takes care of itself. The non-trivial parts
of the program mostly have to do with figuring out which widget resource
does what, and how to use them. If you have trouble understanding this
program, here is a "Hello, world!" to get you started a little slower.
Understanding of the rest of the program will probably have to be
derived from reading the manual and modifying the source yourself.

#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>
#include <X11/Xaw/Label.h>
#include <X11/Shell.h>

// A handy array for setting some properties initially.
// Forget the NULL and you'll segfault, probably.
String app_resources[] = {
	"*label.Label: Hello, world!",
	NULL
};

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	Widget top_level, label;
	XtAppContext app;

	top_level = XtOpenApplication(&app, "Hello, world!", 
		NULL, 0, &argc, argv, 
		app_resources, sessionShellWidgetClass, NULL, 0);
	// Consider most of this magic.
	// Note app_resources and &app.

	label = XtCreateManagedWidget("label", labelWidgetClass, 
		top_level, NULL, 0);
	// No "container widget", since we just need the one


	XtRealizeWidget(top_level);

	XtAppMainLoop(app);

	return 0;
}

In contrast to a great many widget sets, Xt handles all widgets using
the same set of functions. Widget sets may (and do) implement wrapper
functions and special widget functionality, but they are in many cases
fungible.


        Xt/Motif

The Motif library was for a long time the de facto standard in Unix GUI
<http://everything2.com/title/GUI>s. Motif, owned by The Open Group
<http://everything2.com/title/The+Open+Group>, is distributed with most
Unices, and there are open source alternatives such as lesstif
<http://everything2.com/title/lesstif>; still, it is not quite an open
technology. The Motif widget set is more advanced, both technically and
visually, than the Athena widget set. Motif is widely used for building
legacy Unix applications, but some popular OSS
<http://everything2.com/title/OSS> programs like Netscape
<http://everything2.com/title/Netscape> also use(d) it.

Motif, or Xm <http://everything2.com/title/Xm>, is undoubtedly
'prettier' and more sophisticated than Athena. It is also somewhat
abstracted away from Xt using wrapper functions, so Motif code is not as
ideal for demonstrating Xt.


        Writing widgets in Xt

Certainly, a /really/ good writeup would have an example of how to
create a widget in Xt. Unfortunately, even simple widgets like the label
require a gigantic amount of boilerplate work just to get started, so I
won't bother. If you would like to see it for yourself, browse to
xc/lib/Xaw in the X Window System
<http://everything2.com/title/X+Window+System> distribution source.


        Quick guide to important Xt concepts

Here's a rundown of the basic things you need to construct an Xt
program, emphasis on Athena. The first is a list of common data
structures and data, the second is a list of functions, and last (which
you may want to read first) is a description of passing arguments, both
the easy way and the hard way.


          Data structures

  * XtAppContext: You'll need one of these for a given Xt program. It's
    passed to XtOpenApplication as a pointer (&app) and passed plain to
    mainloop.
  * Widget: Every top level window, container widget, and widget is
    contained in a Widget. These are set from widget creation functions,
    and are passed directly. (They are actually typedef'd pointers.)
  * app_resources: The type here is char**, NULL terminated. Called the
    fallback resources, these are used to set some initial resource
    values. Passed to XtOpenApplication.
  * XrmOptionDescRec: Look the exact format of these up in the manual;
    each of these specifies a special command-line argument passed
    directly to a widget resource. A NULL-terminated list of these is
    passed to XtOpenApplication.
  * Arg: An array of Arg's, and an integer counter, are integral in
    using XtSetValues and XtGetValues. Args are typically set with XtSetArg.
  * Callback functions: The signature of these is /void name(Widget w,
    XtPointer client_data, XtPointer call_data)/ and they are the only
    type of callback function in Xt. client_data is sent whatever data
    was specified in the callback, and call_data is a data structure
    specific to the callback.


          Common functions

*XtOpenApplication*

This is the function you use to start any Xt app. It takes a whole list
of things and returns the top-level widget. You can also start the app
by calling four other functions manually, to do different tasks. (Most
old code contains the function XtAppInitialize, which is 'deprecated' in
the spec.) Arguments in order:

  * XtAppContext*: Pass &app, your typical XtAppContext.
  * String: The name of your application and top-level widget
  * XrmOptionDescRec*, int: Array of XrmOptionDescRec entries, and how
    many there are. Acceptably NULL and 0.
  * &argc, argv: Absolutely necessary. Enough said.
  * String*: Usually named app_resources or similar, it's a NULL
    terminated list of Strings indicating initial widget settings.
  * Widget: The type of top-level widget. Typically, use
    sessionShellWidgetClass.
  * Arg*, int: Arguments and number, for top-level widget. See
    explanation below.

*XtCreateManagedWidget*: The canonical way of making a widget. You could
theoretically make a widget with XtCreateWidget and then manage it
later, but this is the easy way.

  * Returns a Widget, representing the one you've just created.
  * String name: Name used in fallback resources, et cetera.
  * Class: Class of the widget, something like labelWidgetClass or
    boxWidgetClass (in Athena).
  * Widget parent: The widget will show up inside this widget, if
    possible. Should be a container widget of some sort.
  * Arg* list, int count: Argument list to pass. See below.

*XtSetValues*, *XtGetValues*: These are pretty simple. They are used for
typical value setting and getting, in the same fashion.

  * Widget: The widget to get/set values on
  * Arg*, int: List of arguments and the number of items in the list.
    See below.

*XtAddCallback*: The function that holds the whole thing together,
XtAddCallback can actually be done with XtSetValues but you don't want
to do it that way, probably.

/More to come. Work-in-progress. Sorry./


          Setting and getting values

You should learn early on how to set and get widget resources, using
both the XtSetArg macro with initializers and the set/get functions, as
well as with the XtVa* functions. The fallback resources are also important.

The hard way is to pass normal initializers (XtOpenApplication,
XtCreateManagedWidget) a special array, built up with XtSetArg macro. In
contrast to regular argument passing in C functions, this is very
laborious and inefficient, but it has advantages, such as being able to
set or get a dynamic, arbitrary number of arguments with a single
function call (since XtSetArg is a macro). Abstracting this process,
though, is not a bad idea, as in the example function:

/* Example function for resizing a widget */
void resize(Widget my_widget, int width, int height)
{
Arg arg_list10 <http://everything2.com/title/10>; // Allocate more than we need, in this case
int arg_count = 0;

if( width > 0 )
 XtSetArg(arg_list[arg_count], XtNwidth, width); arg_count++;

if( height > 0 )
 XtSetArg(arg_list[arg_count], XtNheight, height); arg_count++;

if( width > 0 || height > 0 )
 XtSetValues(my_widget, arg_list, arg_count);
}
